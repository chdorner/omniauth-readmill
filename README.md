# OmniAuth Readmill

This is an unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to [Readmill](http://readmill.com). You will need to [register an app](http://readmill.com/you/apps/new) to get your developer keys.

# Usage

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :readmill, ENV['READMILL_KEY'], ENV['READMILL_SECRET']
end
```

# Example auth hash

```json
{
   "provider":"readmill",
   "uid":5708,
